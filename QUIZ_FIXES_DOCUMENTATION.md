# Arabic Tutor Quiz System - Comprehensive Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Spelling Quiz Right-to-Left Display Issue ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** The spelling quiz was building Arabic words left-to-right, but Arabic is written right-to-left.

**Original Code Issue:**
```javascript
progress.innerHTML = letters.map((l, i) => {
  if (i < currentIndex) return `<span class="done">${l}</span>`;
  if (i === currentIndex) return `<span class="current">?</span>`;
  return `<span class="pending">_</span>`;
}).join('');
```

**Fixed Implementation:**
- Reversed the display order to show Arabic word formation from right-to-left
- Added visual direction indicator: "Build the Arabic word from right to left ←"
- Implemented proper RTL CSS styling with `direction: rtl`
- Added contextual hints for letter positions (first/rightmost, last/leftmost, next)

### 2. Scoring System Bugs ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** All quizzes allowed users to click multiple answers until they found the correct one, artificially inflating scores.

**Original Issues:**
- No prevention of multiple clicks on options
- Wrong answers didn't affect final scores
- Users could keep clicking until they found the right answer

**Fixed Implementation:**
- Added `answered` flag to prevent multiple clicks per question
- Proper tracking of both correct and wrong answers
- Disabled all options after an answer is selected
- Comprehensive scoring with detailed breakdowns
- Percentage calculation and performance ratings

### 3. Poor Feedback System ✅ FIXED

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual and audio feedback for both correct and wrong answers
